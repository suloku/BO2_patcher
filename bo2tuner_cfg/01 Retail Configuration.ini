###### Retail Configuration ######
##################################

# This file contains all supported values that BO2 Tuner supports, with descriptios for each
# one.

# The values in this file are the values the retail game has for each variable (think of them
# as the default values).

# This file can be used as a template 

# Setting a value to "-1" (i.e. wipe_chance = -1) will make the patcher keep the value present in
# the file to be modified (so, if it was previously modified, that setting will remain untouched).

# Commenting or deleting a value setting has the same effect as making it be -1.

############################
###### Extra Settings ######
############################

#  - skip_kain_files (true/false):  if true, kainX.big files will be skipped when patching.
#				    this means none of the settings under the [KAIN] header
#				    will apply (patching will be faster, but not by much)

#  - skip_level_files (true/false): if true, the game's levels .big files will be skipped when 
#				    patching. This means none of the settings under the [NPC], 
#				    [WEAPON] or [CHEST] headers will apply (patching will be a lot
#				    faster).

#   - proportionalBSR (true/false): if true, the pBSR values will be used.
#
# NPCs have a "healthSuckSpeed" paramenter, which is the "blood per second (bps)"
# that is sucked. Default for all NPCs is 25 bps. This means an NPC with 50
# normalMaxBlood will need 2 seconds to get his blood completely sucked by Kain
# (30 blood / 25 bps = 1.2 seconds). Later NPCs have more Blood to be sucked, i.e.
# Hylden Warriors have 175 Blood, making Kain take 7 seconds to get all the Blood.
# When proportionalBSR is enabled, the vaue will be calculated depending on the NPC's
# normalMaxBlood. This applies after the NPC normalMaxBlood is updated from the config
# if present. This means an NPC with 30 blood (i.e. female peasants) will use the
# pBSR_0_50 value (default 1.0), thus 30/1.0 = 30 bps, meaning Kain will take 1 seconds
# to suck all the Blood. For the hylden warrior (175 blood), the pBSR_151_plus value would
# be used (defaul 2.0), so 175/2.0 = 87.5 bps, making kain take 2 seconds to suck all the
# blood instead of the retail's version 7 seconds.
#
# Default value's goal is to make the blood suck animation feel a little longer for stronger
# NPCs, but still take between 1 and 2 seconds at most.
#
# Another option would be to not use this and modify all NPCs values. I.E. making normalMaxBlood 
# healthSuckSpeed the same value would result on Kain taking 1 second to suck all the blood.

# IMPORTANT!: pBSR_* values DO NOT support the -1 setting.

# kainFile
#  - default: will apply to all files, unless another [KAIN] with the appropiate filename is present
#	kainb/kainc/kaind/kaine/kainf/kaing
#	note: the default entry MUST be the first one
#  - wipe_chance: % chance of kain wiping his mouth after sucking blood
#  - lorePerParticle: how many units define a lore chest "orb". The amount of lore in chests MUST
#	be divisible by this number WITH NO REMAINDER. I.E. Red Chest has 30 lore,
#	lorePerParticle is 10, thus 3 Lore "orbs" are sucked.
#  - get_up_presses: how many consecutive button presses Kain needs to quickly get up from the ground
#  - VampireWeaponMultiplier: damage multiplier when obtaining a weapon chest.
#  - MaxLoreLevels: maximum level Kain can achieve*
#  - level_XX_LORE: amount of lore Kain needs to level up
#  - level_XX_HP: amount of HP Kain has at this specific level
#	* Note: there is a bug in the game in which after you get to the maximum level
#		and fill the Lore bar, Kain's Lore level will be equal to MaxLoreLevels.
#		This makes the game read the HP from the next level in the table. In the
#		retail version of the game, this means level 26, which is inexistent (levels
#		range from 0-25), and reads the next value stored in the game's data, which
#		happens to be ZERO, thus making Kain's HP be zero in this setting and Kain
#		dying from the first thirst.
#		Fix: the simpler fix, is to change MaxLoreLevels to 25, as the game will then
#		read a correct HP value. As you can see in retail game Kain gains nothing after
#		level 19, so MaxLoreLevels = 20 for retail is what makes more sense.

# REMEMBER! The "kainFile = default" entry MUST be the first one.

###### Lore Chest Settings ######
#################################

#  - chestFile: coll_lore for Red chests and coll_biglore for blue chests
#  - lore: amount of lore the chests will have
#  - levels: levels to which this chest configuration will apply
# 	     default or any level name (see included file with the patcher for level names)
#	     default MUST be the first entry
#	     default will apply whenever a level is not specified
#	     if there is no default entry, only the specified levels will be modified
#
#
#			!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#		The amount of lore ean each chest must be an exact multiple of
#		[KAIN]'s lorePerParticle setting. I.E. if "lorePerParticle" is set to 30
#		the minimum amount of lore in a chest MUST be 30. Values like 40 or 50
#		are invalid, only multiples of 30 (60, 90, 120...) will correctly work.
#		Setting "lorePerParticle" to 1 or 2 will also work to have any amount of
#		lore in chests, but a lot of particles will appear on screen. If that
#		amount is too big the game might crash (i.e. setting lorePerParticle to 1
#		and having a chest with 5000 lore). Test this properly.
#
#
#   note:  The game has a total of 52 Red Chests and 52 Blue chests.
#	   Refer to included files for how many chests of each kind are in each level.
#
# EXAMPLE
# 	The following sample entry will make all Blue chests in the Wharves level (Chapter 12)
#	have double the normal amount of lore
#
#[CHEST]
#chestFile = coll_biglore
#lore = 100
#levels = wh01, wh02, wh03, wh04, wh05, wh06, wh07, wh08, wh09, wh10, wh11, wh12, wh13
#
# EXAMPLE 2
# 	The following sample entry will make the first two chests in the game have more lore
#	(default is 30, 3 particles, this will generate 8 particles as default "lorePerParticle"
#	is 10.
#
#[CHEST]
#chestFile = coll_lore
#lore = 80

# REMEMBER! The "levels = default" entries for coll_lore and coll_biglore MUST be the first ones.
