# proportionalBSR (true/false): if true, the pBSR values will be used.
#
# NPCs have a "healthSuckSpeed" paramenter, which is the "blood per second (bps)"
# that is sucked. Default for all NPCs is 25 bps. This means an NPC with 50
# normalMaxBlood will need 2 seconds to get his blood completely sucked by Kain
# (30 blood / 25 bps = 1.2 seconds). Later NPCs have more Blood to be sucked, i.e.
# Hylden Warriors have 175 Blood, making Kain take 7 seconds to get all the Blood.
# When proportionalBSR is enabled, the vaue will be calculated depending on the NPC's
# normalMaxBlood. This applies after the NPC normalMaxBlood is updated from the config
# if present. This means an NPC with 30 blood (i.e. female peasants) will use the
# pBSR_0_50 value (default 1.0), thus 30/1.0 = 30 bps, meaning Kain will take 1 seconds
# to suck all the Blood. For the hylden warrior (175 blood), the pBSR_151_plus value would
# be used (defaul 2.0), so 175/2.0 = 87.5 bps, making kain take 2 seconds to suck all the
# blood instead of the retail's version 7 seconds.
#
# Default value's goal is to make the blood suck animation feel a little longer for stronger
# NPCs, but still take between 1 and 2 seconds at most.
#
# Another option would be to not use this and modify all NPCs values. I.E. making normalMaxBlood 
# healthSuckSpeed the same value would result on Kain taking 1 second to suck all the blood.

###### KAIN'S Settings ######

# kainFile
#  - default: will apply to all files, unless another [KAIN] with the appropiate filename is present
#	kainb/kainc/kaind/kaine/kainf/kaing
#	note: the default entry MUST be the first one
#  - wipe_chance: % chance of kain wiping his mouth after sucking blood
#  - lorePerParticle: how many units define a lore chest "orb". The amount of lore in chests MUST
#	be divisible by this number WITH NO REMAINDER. I.E. Red Chest has 30 lore,
#	lorePerParticle is 10, thus 3 Lore "orbs" are sucked.
#  - get_up_presses: how many consecutive button presses Kain needs to quickly get up from the ground
#  - VampireWeaponMultiplier: damage multiplier when obtaining a weapon chest.
#  - MaxLoreLevels: maximum level Kain can achieve*
#  - level_XX_LORE: amount of lore Kain needs to level up
#  - level_XX_HP: amount of HP Kain has at this specific level
#	* Note: there is a bug in the game in which after you get to the maximum level
#		and fill the Lore bar, Kain's Lore level will be equal to MaxLoreLevels.
#		This makes the game read the HP from the next level in the table. In the
#		retail version of the game, this means level 26, which is inexistent (levels
#		range from 0-25), and reads the next value stored in the game's data, which
#		happens to be ZERO, thus making Kain's HP be zero in this setting and Kain
#		dying from the first thirst.
#		Fix: the simpler fix, is to change MaxLoreLevels to 25, as the game will then
#		read a correct HP value. As you can see in retail game Kain gains nothing after
#		level 19, so MaxLoreLevels = 20 for retail is what makes more sense.
